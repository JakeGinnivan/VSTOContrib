VSTOContrib
===========

VSTO Contrib is all about making VSTO development better for developers. It allows you to separate your concerns, use IoC and write more testable clean code in your VSTO add-ins.

## Getting Started
A getting started video is available at http://youtu.be/TxRjNsaVX6U, it goes through quite a few of the concepts in VSTO Contrib to help you get started

If you just want to dive in, install `VSTO.<OfficeProduct>` from nuget, for example `VSTO.Outlook` for an outlook package.

Included in the package is a readme with some code snippets to help you get started. Also check out the sample projects in this repo, there is a simple one for each of the Office applications and will help you get started
